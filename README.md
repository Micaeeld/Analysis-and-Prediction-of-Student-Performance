# Student Performance Analysis and Prediction
This notebook presents an analysis and prediction of student performance using a dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains information about various students, including features such as their demographic information, family background, and academic performance in mathematics.

## Dataset
The dataset is composed of 395 rows and 31 columns. The columns include:

- gender: gender of the student
- race/ethnicity: race/ethnicity of the student
- parental level of education: highest education level of the student's parent(s)
- lunch: whether the student receives free/reduced lunch or not
- test preparation course: whether the student completed a test preparation course or not
- math score: the student's score on the mathematics exam
- reading score: the student's score on the reading exam
- writing score: the student's score on the writing exam
- and several other features related to the student's demographic and family background

## Data Preparation
Before creating the performance prediction model, the data was pre-processed and prepared for training. Some of the data preparation steps included:

- Cleaning missing data
- Encoding categorical features
- Normalizing the data
- Performance Analysis

## Conclusion
This notebook presented an analysis and prediction of student performance using a dataset available on Kaggle. The findings from the exploratory data analysis can provide useful insights for educators and policymakers in improving student outcomes. The Linear Regression model can be used to predict a student's performance in math, allowing educators to identify students who may need additional support and resources to succeed.
